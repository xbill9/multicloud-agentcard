"""One credential seam for every outbound leg of the mesh.

The mesh is asymmetric in exactly one way that matters: every callee here
consumes *external* OIDC -- AWS IAM OIDC providers, Entra Federated Identity
Credentials, AgentCore ``CUSTOM_JWT`` -- but only some *callers* can mint an
OIDC token. Cloud Run can, with an arbitrary audience, which is why the
coordinator runs there and why all three legs below start from the same
metadata mint. See ``docs/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`` in the repo this forked from,
xbill9/multicloud-a2a-subagent.

Three mechanisms, one shape::

    GCP -> GCP    Google ID token           Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
    GCP -> AWS    STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity -> SigV4 signature
    GCP -> Azure  Entra FIC token exchange  Authorization: Bearer <jwt>

``httpx.Auth`` is the shape because it is the only one that spans both: a
bearer header and a signature over the request body are the same object to
httpx, and all three vendor client SDKs accept an ``httpx.AsyncClient``. That
also means the **agent-card fetch is authenticated by the same credential as
the call** -- discovery is privileged, and a card fetch that 403s while the
call would have succeeded is the single most confusing failure in this space.

No vendor SDK is imported here. The coordinator calls three clouds; making it
depend on three clouds' auth libraries to do so would be the wrong trade. It
is httpx plus the standard library.

Logging
-------
Every provider response is logged at its boundary, in full, on failure. This
is deliberate and it is worth more than the federation work itself: in the
predecessor series nothing cost more time than auth errors that could not be
read -- an adapter that reported an HTTP status and discarded the STS body,
and an error that travelled back as a *tool result* and got paraphrased by the
model into "an issue with the web identity token". A raised message is not an
observable. Raise and log.

Successful responses are logged without their token material.

    ``WorkloadIdentity`` needs a metadata server and a workstation has none,
    which is the gap "Reaching the deployed three" in README.md describes. For
    the GCP leg specifically that gap turned out to be narrower than it looked:
    measured 2026-08-25 against the deployed Cloud Run agent, a plain
    ``gcloud auth print-identity-token`` from a developer account is accepted
    and returns the card. The AWS and Azure legs are untouched by this -- their
    trust conditions pin the *subject* to the coordinator service account's
    numeric ID, and a developer's token has a different ``sub``.

    Two measured details that make this less obvious than it reads:

    - **The audience cannot be pinned for a user account.**
      ``--audiences=<url>`` is refused outright with "Invalid account type for
      `--audiences`. Requires valid service account." So the token this mints
      carries ``aud`` = gcloud's own OAuth client ID,
      ``32555940559.apps.googleusercontent.com``, *not* the service URL that
      ``GoogleIdTokenAuth`` was written to pass.
    - **Cloud Run accepts it anyway.** The invoker check honours Google's
      allowlisted CLI client ID rather than requiring ``aud`` to be the service
      URL. The requested audience is therefore accepted and recorded here, but
      it does not reach the token -- so this mode must never be read as
      evidence that an audience condition holds. It is authorization by IAM
      role membership, nothing more.

    A service-account account *can* pin the audience, so the flag is passed
    when it works and dropped, loudly, when gcloud refuses it.

    ``AwsSigV4Auth`` starts at the GCE metadata server, and a workstation has

    mode exists to fetch a card from AgentCore from a laptop, and it is a
    **different measurement**, not a workaround for the same one:

    - The federated path proves that a *workload* OIDC token satisfies the role
      trust policy. This proves only that whoever is configured in
      ``~/.aws/credentials`` has ``bedrock-agentcore:GetAgentCard``.
    - So a card fetched this way says nothing about whether the deployed
      coordinator could fetch it. The mode name is carried into the report for
      exactly that reason; do not read the two as interchangeable rows.

    Everything downstream of the credential is shared with the federated mode:
    the same ``_sign_request``, the same signed ``x-amzn-*`` headers. What is
    being swapped here is the origin of the key, and nothing else.
