"""The outbound legs of an **AWS-rooted** master.

``peers.auth`` implements the legs that start from Google, and every one
of them begins at the same metadata mint. This module implements the two that
start from AWS, and the reason it is a separate file is that they do not share
that root -- they start from an AWS role, which changes what is possible:

    AWS -> GCP    signed GetCallerIdentity -> GCP STS -> impersonate -> ID token
    AWS -> Azure  client secret                            **not keyless**

That asymmetry is the experiment in step 5 of ``docs/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`` in
xbill9/multicloud-a2a-subagent. Holding
the three agents fixed and moving the master is what makes it attributable, and
this module is the half of the seam that the AWS-rooted run needs.

Why AWS -> GCP is keyless and AWS -> Azure is not
-------------------------------------------------
Google's Workload Identity Federation accepts an **AWS-shaped** subject token:
a SigV4-signed ``GetCallerIdentity`` request, serialised and handed over
unsent. Google replays it against AWS STS to learn who signed it. No JWT is
involved, so this leg does **not** depend on whether an AWS runtime can mint
OIDC -- which is the open question that blocks so much else here.

Entra has no equivalent. Its Federated Identity Credential wants a JWT
assertion from an issuer with OIDC discovery, and an ECS task role or Lambda
execution role is not one. Outside EKS/IRSA or Cognito there is nothing for AWS
to present, so this leg falls back to a client secret and the mesh stops being
secretless. That is a measured boundary, not an implementation shortcut, and
``EntraClientSecretAuth`` is loud about it for exactly that reason.

    Four steps, of which only the last two leave the process::

        1. resolve the AWS role credentials
        2. build and sign a GetCallerIdentity request -- and do not send it
        3. hand that to Google STS, which replays it against AWS to learn the caller
        4. impersonate the target service account for an ID token

    Step 2 is the part worth understanding: the *subject token* is a signed HTTP
    request, serialised as JSON and never issued by us. Google issues it. That
    is why this leg works from a runtime that cannot mint OIDC at all, and it is
    the asymmetry that makes AWS -> GCP cheap while AWS -> Azure is not.

    Step 4 exists because Cloud Run validates an **ID token** whose audience is
    its own service URL, and the STS exchange yields an *access* token. The
    federated principal therefore needs ``roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator``
    on the service account it impersonates -- a grant that is easy to forget and
    which denies with a 403 naming the *service account*, not the pool.

    Cost, relative to the GCP-rooted equivalent: that leg is one hop to the
