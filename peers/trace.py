"""Collect what each leg actually did on the wire, without threading it through.

The problem this solves is structural. A leg's HTTP calls are made in three
different places -- the credential mint inside ``peers.auth``, the
agent-card fetch inside the vendor's SDK, the A2A call inside the same SDK --
and none of them can see the others. Passing a collector down would mean
changing the signature of every client stack and every auth adapter, and the
SDKs in the middle would have to agree to carry it, which they will not.

So the collector is a context variable. ``cards.fetch`` opens one per leg;
the httpx event hooks and the auth boundary logger append to whatever is open.
``asyncio.gather`` copies the context into each task, so three legs running
concurrently write into three separate traces with no coordination and no
locking. Nothing outside a ``collect()`` block records anything, which is why
the hermetic tests and the in-process adapters produce empty traces rather
than fictional ones.

**Never record a credential.** No headers, no bodies on success, no query
strings -- Google's metadata mint takes the audience as a query parameter and
returns the token as the body, and a trace that has to be sanitised before it
can be shown to anyone is a trace that will not be shown. The label carries
whatever the calling code chose to name, which is already audience-level
detail written by us rather than by a provider.
